# Computer Vision Proficiency

Have you been searching resources to learn about 3D computer vision for hours? Me too...

I will teach you **all you need to get started on the field of 3D computer vision** (aka Multiple View Geometry Computer Vision, Geometric Computer vision, 3D Vision, ... can we just use the name 3D computer vision, please?). We are also going to learn about the MATHEMATICS behind this field (don't be scare, I'll guide you through them all the way ðŸ˜‰) and apply what we learn doing with C++.

At the end, we'll do some interesting projects with 2D and 3D computer vision!

But first, let's get started with 2D computer vision ðŸŽ‰

# 2D Computer Vision
Advice: If you already know the concepts you see on the table of contents of 2D computer vision, feel free to skip to the section of 3D computer vision!
